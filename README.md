    - Create a dictionary representing a person with keys for "name", "age", and "country". Print each key-value pair.
    - Create a dictionary representing a book with keys for "title", "author", and "year". Print each key-value pair.
    - Create a dictionary representing a fruit basket with keys for fruit names and their quantities. Print each key-value pair.
    - Use the `get()` method to retrieve the value for the "author" key from the book dictionary. Print the value.
    - Use the `keys()` method to get a list of all keys in the fruit basket dictionary. Print the list.
    - Use the `values()` method to get a list of all values in the fruit basket dictionary. Print the list.
    - Add a new key-value pair to the person dictionary for "city" with a value of your choice. Print the updated dictionary.
    - Update the value for the "quantity" key in the fruit basket dictionary to a new value. Print the updated dictionary.
    - Remove the "year" key from the book dictionary. Print the updated dictionary.

14. **Sets:**
    - Create a set of your favorite numbers and print the set.
    - Create a set of unique letters from a string and print the set.
    - Create a set of fruits and a set of vegetables. Perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference on these sets.
